The finalized programs for the project can be found in the finalPrograms
folder. The esp32Controller.ino program should be uploaded to the ESP32
controller via the Arduino IDE, while the GroundStation.py should be
run on the ground station computer. In order for the ground station to 
properly connect, the ESP32 needs to boot up first to create the port
for wireless connection.

The pinouts for the ESP32 can be found in the header of the esp32Controller
script, while the keyboard commands can be found in the header for the 
GroundStation script.
